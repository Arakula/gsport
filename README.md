# GSport: an Apple IIgs Emulator 

GSport is a portable (in the programming sense) Apple IIgs emulator, based on the KEGS cross-platform IIgs emulator by Kent Dickey. The base emulator builds and runs on all of the same platforms that KEGS did, and the new capabilities are being integrated as contributors have time and interest.  Full documentation is available at the GSport website [here.](https://david-schmidt.github.io/gsport/)

## Project Goals

The main goal for GSport is to provide a free, open ecosystem for the continuation of cross-platform development of IIgs emulation.

Some interesting advances that initially spawned this project are Uthernet and printer support. Now that those objectives are met, we will move on to the next objectives. Do you have something that you wish a GS emulator did?  Dive in and contribute!
